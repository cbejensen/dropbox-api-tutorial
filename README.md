The code used for an upcoming Scrimba tutorial on how to use the Dropbox API, specifically the JavaScript SDK.

## How do I use this?

After cloning the repo, enter `npm run {lessonNum}` in your terminal, where `{lessonNum}` is the lesson you want to view.

## What will I learn?

Besides retrieving, reading, updating, and moving files and folders via Dropbox, we will make use of cool JavaScript concepts and techniques like:

- Closures
- Recursion
- Promises
- Async/Await
- Arrow functions
- Array methods like map, filter, sort, and reduce
- Spread operators
- For of loops
- The new `options` argument for `toLocaleString()` (makes rendering readable dates much easier)
- CSS Variables
